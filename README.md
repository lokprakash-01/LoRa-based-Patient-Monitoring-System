# LoRa-based-Patient-Monitoring-System
This Arduino sketch orchestrates the integration of diverse sensor functionalities into a cohesive system. The code encompasses the setup and utilization of several sensors, including load cells (HX711), an MLX90614 temperature sensor, and a pulse sensor. Upon initialization in the setup function, each sensor is configured for precise operation. The main loop function continuously manages the sensor readings, processing them as needed. Load cell data, after calibration and tare operations, is acquired alongside object temperatures from the MLX90614 sensor and pulse readings from the pulse sensor. Through LoRa communication, the system transmits this aggregated sensor data wirelessly, potentially enabling remote monitoring or control applications. Overall, this code forms the backbone of a versatile sensor platform, offering opportunities for applications in various domains, from health monitoring to industrial automation.
